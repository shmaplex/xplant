    q: "What kind of worms should I use?",
    a: (
      <>
        Red Wigglers (Eisenia fetida) are the most popular choice for home
        composting. They&rsquo;re hardy, efficient, and love decaying organic
        matter.
      </>
    ),

  {
    q: "Can I keep my worm bin indoors?",
    a: (
      <>
        Absolutely. Worm bins are odor-free when maintained properly and can
        live comfortably under your sink, in a closet, or anywhere that&rsquo;s
        not too hot or cold.
      </>

  {
    q: "How can I support the project?",
    a: (
      <>
        We&rsquo;re glad you asked! Soon you&rsquo;ll be able to buy compost
        kits, merch, and maybe even sponsor worms. For now, just follow along,
        share, and stay dirty.

    q: "How are live worms shipped?",
    a: (
      <>
        We ship live worms Monday through Friday, packed with care in breathable
        bedding. We only ship domestically within South Korea using CJ Logistics
        or Korea Post.

  {
    q: "What should I do when my worms arrive?",
    a: (
      <>
        Open the package immediately and transfer the worms into their prepared
        bin. Give them time to adjust and avoid feeding for the first day or
        two.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What do worms eat?",
    a: (
      <>
        Worms love fruit and veggie scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and
        shredded paper. Avoid meat, dairy, citrus, oily foods, and anything
        salty or spicy.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How many worms do I need to start?",
    a: (
      <>
        For most households, 500g to 1kg of Red Wigglers is enough to get
        started. The size of your bin and the amount of food waste you generate
        can guide this.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Do worm bins smell bad?",
    a: (
      <>
        Not at all! A healthy worm bin smells like fresh earth. Odors are
        usually a sign of overfeeding or too much moisture.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What temperature is best for worms?",
    a: (
      <>
        Worms thrive between 15&deg;C and 25&deg;C. Keep your bin out of direct
        sunlight and protect it from freezing in the winter.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use worm castings right away?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes! Worm castings are ready to use once they&rsquo;re dark, crumbly,
        and free of visible food scraps.
