          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            XPlant began with two people and a shared obsession: one a former
            computer scientist who loves clean systems, and the other a lifelong
            gardener, fascinated by plants and soil. Together, as a small
            husband&ndash;and&ndash;wife team, we wanted to bring the joy and
            science of plant tissue culture to everyoneâ€”without the intimidating
            lab coat.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Our work blends curiosity with cleanliness: simple kits, clear
            guides, and a belief that anyone can grow something incredible with
            just a bit of care. Every medium we mix, every culture jar we ship,
            and every guide we write comes from that partnership between science
            and soil.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              Plants connect us back to what is slow and alive. By making plant
              science approachable, we hope to grow a new culture: one that
              values nature, curiosity, and care.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              We&apos;re not a big company. We&apos;re a family business,
              working in Korea, trying to make sustainable propagation tools
              that are as clean and thoughtful as the plants they grow.
